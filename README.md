# Advaced-Data-Analysis-Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects I made throughout the Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree Program.
## Project 1
Here, I investigated the TMDB datsset. I cleaned, investigated and drew insights using python. The python libraries used were pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
## Project 2
A/B test was performed using python. The libraries used were pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
## Project 3
I used the fordgobike dataset. I performed some data cleaning, then, performed both exploratory and explanatory analysis by creating visuals using seaborn and matplotlib.
